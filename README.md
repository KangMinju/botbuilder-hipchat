# botbuilder-hipchat
Connect your bot to HipChat. This is a local connector, similar to `TextBot`
not a way to use HipChat with the [BotConnecterService](http://docs.botframework.com/connector/getstarted/#navtitle)

# Let's go!
Check out  [sample.js](./sample.js). You'll need a HipChat account and password, and you can 
get the [settings](https://glgroup.hipchat.com/account/xmpp) right from the HipChat portal.
